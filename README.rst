Pianoputer.js
=============

The pianoputer allows you to play piano pieces on your computer keyboard, `like in this video<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z410eauCnHc>`_.

In the video I use the `Python version<https://github.com/Zulko/pianoputer>` of the program, which works great, but not anyone wants to deal with Python. This project is ab out a browser-based Javascript implementation of the pianoputer.

For now it *works* on Google Chrome, for QWERTY layouts, but it's still far from perfect, I am not a JS guru, at all. Anyone who wants to improve the program is most welcome. The key features I have in mind are:

- No lag (the sound plays immediately when you press a key)
- Support of multiple keyboard layouts.
- A choice of several possible sounds.

Run the program
=================

Just unzip everything in one folder and open ``pianoputer.html``.
To get a new keyboard configuration (which is basically a list of the codes of the keys in your browser) run ``print_keydowns.html``.
